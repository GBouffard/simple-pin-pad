This is Guillaume's Simple pin pad:

Main functionalities:
• Buttons work with either touch or clicks
• The pin is hidden except for the last number
• The exact pin is hardcoded somewhere (and is the birthday of my first daughter. You already have a clue, nice init?)
• The pin is 4 digits long
• When 4 digits are entered the pin is checked
• If the inserted PIN is correct the screen displays OK and the pin is reset
• If the inserted PIN is wrong the screen displays ERROR and the pin is reset

Technologies used:

Methodology:
----
- I first scaffolded the app through react-create-app.
